               <Accordion title="What is Career Counselling ?">
          Career Counselling is a process that focuses on helping one understand
          one’s own self, as well as work trends, so that one can take an
          informed decision about career and education. Career Counselling helps
          manage a diverse range of problems such as low concentration levels to
          poor time management, trust issues with family to non-agreement
          between parents and children on which career to choose. In order to
          understand Career Counselling a little better, let us look at its most
          important elements:
          <h3>A Qualified Career Counsellor</h3>A genuine Career Counsellor is
          the essence of right guidance, which is why he/she is the most
          important element of any career counselling process. Career
          Counsellors are experts in psychology, which means that they should
          hold at least a post-graduate degree in Psychology/Applied Psychology,
          and/or a diploma in Counselling Psychology. Career Counsellors who
          give guidance for a particular field, such as engineering, management,
          hospitality, etc., must be experts in the concerned domain. A good
          Career Counsellor is a problem solver, a keen listener and observer,
          and has sufficient knowledge of various fields to guide you in your
          career decisions.
          <h3>A Secure Environment</h3>
          The process of career counselling involves creating a safe and secure
          environment, where the student feels at ease and is able to discuss
          his/her life and career, without any hesitation. A part of this secure
          environment is the assurance of confidentiality of the information
          shared by the student.
          <h3>An Agreement Of Trust And Confidence</h3>
          The Career Counselling process is based on a relationship of trust and
          confidence between the career counsellor and student. In order to help
          him/her, the counsellor may sometimes talk about their emotional and
          developmental issues, which can be a little stressful. The student and
          the parent needs to place an enormous amount of faith in the
          Counsellor to take care of such matters.
          <h3>Relevant Psychometric Assessments</h3>
          Psychometric Testing (Career Assessment) is a scientific and
          standardized process carried out to evaluate a person’s aptitude and
          personality. Psychometric assessments are a Counsellor’s tools, which
          are used to obtain the most important information about a student’s
          behavior, emotional strength, interests, and skills. This information
          helps to facilitate on what kind of careers would be suitable for
          him/her. In this manner, relevant and standardized assessments help a
          student understand him/herself better, and career decisions can be
          made more easily.

        <Accordion title="Why Do I Need Career Counselling?">
          All of us require career guidance at some point in our life. It helps
          us get insights about ourselves, our career and what we can do to
          improve it. Here are a few ways in which career counselling helps us:
          <h3>Helps Pick The Right Career</h3>
          Career Counsellors are experts at assessing your aptitude,
          personality, interests, and other aspects of you. They use this
          evaluation to suggest the best career options from all the available
          and relevant options.
          <h3>Helps Provide Expert Resources</h3>
          Career Counselling provides access to the resources and knowledge that
          a career expert possesses. This knowledge of Careers, their scope and
          the paths to pursue them are most important from the point of view of
          a parent and child, since most of the times, parents or guardians do
          not have that kind of knowledge.
          <h3>Helps Gain Confidence And Insight</h3>
          Career Counselling helps a counselee understand the hurdles in his/her
          career path. This knowledge helps to develop the confidence to
          overcome these hurdles. It is the duty of a good counsellor to provide
          such insight and confidence to the counselee.
          <h3>Helps Change Unwanted Behavior Patterns</h3>
          Students and professionals have habits that are hard to break, such as
          procrastinating, not keeping updated on latest developments in their
          chosen career paths, neglecting emotional and mental health, not
          trying to self-motivate, etc. A Career Counsellor helps break such
          behavioral patterns that lead to unproductive activities, both at home
          and in school/college/work.
          <h3>Helps Remove Career-Related Frustration</h3>
          Choosing a career can be a demanding task for both parents and
          children. A lack of any source of venting out emotions and thoughts
          may add to the existing frustration. Career Counselling provides a
          platform where such frustrations can be reduced, and focus is
          re-directed to selecting the best career options.
          <h3>Provides A Role-Model</h3>
          Career Counselling helps students connect to experts who have enough
          life experiences to share. They are role models who have accomplished
          much, and helped people in their life. This is why Career Counselling
          can serve as an inspiration to those who require it.
          <h3>Helps Bring Stability In Thought</h3>
          Career Counsellors can help you remain calm when it comes to taking a
          career decision. Counselling helps bring about focus, and maintain
          that focus throughout in our activities. Through proper scheduling and
          planning, they try and make your life more organized.

        <Accordion title="Who Need Career Counselling & When?">
          The perfect time for students to seek Career Counselling is during the
          ages 13-17 years (8th standard to 12th standard). This is a time of
          many changes taking place in their life, both physical and emotional,
          such as transitioning from school to college, and trying to “fit in”
          with peers. It is also a time when career decisions are made. This is
          why they need someone to guide them in the right direction at this
          time.<br></br>
          Most of our parents are actively involved in shaping our career, in
          fact at least 51% of Indian parents’ priority is their child’s
          financial success (Survey by HSBC Retail Banking and Wealth Management
          in a report titled “ The Value of Education: Learning for Life”). We
          can safely assume that our parents follow a hands-on approach when it
          comes to making career decisions for us. Sometimes, it works and many
          a times, it does not. We can attribute this to the fact that every
          child is unique, and it is extremely hard for parents or teachers to
          always recognize the child’s strengths or weaknesses, and his passion
          or dislikes. This is another reason why career counselling is needed.
          <br></br>
          For students in college, who are still confused about what they want
          to do, as well as for professionals who want to transition from their
          field to something they love, career counselling helps in the
          following manner: Career Counselling helps them understand the career
          options that they have, and how to pursue them. Career Counselling
          helps them understand their own strengths and weaknesses with regard
          to their present course or profession, and lets them know what career
          they would be suited for. Career Counselling gives them a platform to
          voice their opinion about what they would like to pursue, as well as
          discuss the obstacles that they may be worried about. Career
          Counselling makes the transition from one field to another a
          non-stressful event. Career Counselling helps give them the required
          confidence to change their domain, with the support of an experienced
          mentor.

        <Accordion title="What Is Career Guidance?">
          The word “guidance” originated back in the 1530s, and is defined as
          the process of directing conduct. Career guidance can be defined as a
          comprehensive, developmental program designed to assist individuals in
          making and implementing informed educational and occupational choices.
          In simple words, it is a journey on which people develop to make
          mature and informed decisions. It is the act of guiding or showing the
          way; it is the act of seeking advice.
          <br></br>
          Career guidance is the guidance given to individuals to help them
          acquire the knowledge, information, skills, and experience necessary
          to identify career options, and narrow them down to make one career
          decision. This career decision then results in their social, financial
          and emotional well-being throughout.
          <br></br>
          In an age where career queries are not uncommon, it’s important to
          answer queries related to career guidance or career, in general.

        <Accordion title="What Are Career Assessments?">
          Career assessments, simply put, are a set of tests, tools, or analyses
          that help a student understand how multiple traits like those of
          choices, likes & dislikes, personality, et cetera determine possible
          success and satisfaction with different career options, and varied
          work environments. The beauty of career assessments, is, that there
          are no right or wrong answers, there are just answers that sync best
          with you.<br></br>
          The inclusions of a career assessment vary from product to product,
          and company tocompany. While there are some assessments which make use
          of obsolete techniques and parameters, there are some which are trying
          to bring about a pragmatic change to career testing and assessments.
          There are a couple of elements that are coherent to all assessments –
          Interest, Aptitude & Personality. It’s the approach to test, and
          additional elements being tested that make all the difference.
          <br></br>
          While some assessments simply ask the student to list their interest
          areas, and mark their personality traits, there are some that approach
          questions with situations and psychometric tools that are more
          scientific, advanced and progressive.
          <br></br>
          Mindler’s proprietary 5-D assessment bases a student’s career decision
          on an exhaustive analysis of basic orientation, interest, personality,
          battery of aptitudes and emotional & social intelligence. It is the
          only assessment so far, to have included a section on emotional &
          social intelligence, and gone as far as determining motivators for an
          individual.
          <br></br>
          Career assessments are designed to help a student discover their
          innate traits, skills, and talents. A self-assessment, by the student
          can be particularly helpful for understand their strengths, and areas
          of development, and finalizing on their career.
          <br></br>
          The biggest benefit is, of course, better understanding of one’s
          career needs and possibilities based on who they actually are, and
          discovering all the alternatives that could work for them. When
          coupled with professional counsel, career assessments could very well
          help one draft a roadmap for their entire career.
          <br></br>
          Many students today wonder, if not this, then what? Career assessments
          not only help a student make the right career call, they also provide
          the answer to what other domains you can go in, if not a particular
          one. Thus, at all times, a student has the flexibility of moving from
          one career domain to the other, if need be.
          <br></br>
          Additionally, career assessments also enable life-skills development
          for students. Mindler’s world-class assessment comes complete with
          development plans for building critical life skills like
          decision-making, teamwork, et cetera.
